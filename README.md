# Language & Sentiment Detectionâ€”Hate Speech Multi-Label Classifier
This Python script is a machine learning model that identifies and categorizes hate speech in a given text. The dataset featured in this project is from The hate speech measurement project https://hatespeech.berkeley.edu/, the dataset aggregated social media comments from Youtube, Reddit, and Twitter. Categories include race, religion, origin, gender, sexuality, age, and disability. The script uses the DistilBert model for sequence classification from HuggingFace's Transformers library. The base code for this script was inspired by Wesley A. Chung.

# Requirements
The script requires the following Python libraries:

## numpy
## torch
## transformers
## atasets
## matplotlib
## sklearn
## tqdm 

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install numpy torch transformers datasets matplotlib sklearn tqdm

# Usage
The script does not take any direct input parameters. It uses a pre-defined hate speech dataset from HuggingFace's Datasets library.

You can run the script using Python:

python hate_speech_multilabel_classifier.py

# Outputs
The script will output a trained model that can classify hate speech into specific categories. It also provides a pipeline for classifying new text.

The script also outputs visualizations of the count and percentage of hate speech types in the dataset.

# Important Details
This script uses a multi-label classification approach, meaning each text can belong to multiple categories of hate speech. The model is trained for one epoch, but this can be adjusted.

The trained model's state is saved after each epoch. The path to the saved model should be updated according to your environment.

# Use Cases:

1. Content Moderation: The model can be used to automatically identify and flag hate speech in user-generated content on social media platforms, online communities, and comment sections of news websites.

2. Research: Researchers studying online behavior, hate speech trends, or the impact of hate speech on various communities could use this tool to analyze large amounts of data.

3. Policy Making: Government agencies or NGOs working on digital policy, online safety, or anti-discrimination laws could use this tool to gather evidence and inform their policy decisions.

4. Training Other Models: The multilabel classifier can be used as a base to train other models for more specific tasks related to hate speech detection.

5. Educational Purposes: It can be used as a teaching tool for students learning about NLP, machine learning, and ethical AI.
